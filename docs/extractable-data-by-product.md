# Extractable Data by Product — AI FinOps

Every field that can be pulled from each AI product/service, for FinOps analytics.
Billing model is intentionally omitted here — this is the **data surface** itself.
All of this is loaded into a portable database by
`platform/data-store/build_store.py` (table `extractable_data_catalog`).

Products covered: **Copilot Studio · GitHub Copilot · Microsoft 365 Copilot ·
Foundry/Azure OpenAI · Copilot Cowork/Autopilot · Azure ML · Microsoft Fabric**.

**Handoff note:** the Bronze CSVs in `platform/fabric/bronze_out/` and the portable
`platform/data-store/finops.db` are the exact interchange a teammate can lift into a
Fabric Lakehouse (via `platform/fabric/load_bronze.py`) once a Power BI license is
assigned. Nothing here depends on Fabric being available.
